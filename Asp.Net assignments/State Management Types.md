**State Management Types**
1.client-side state management
2.server-side state management

**client-side state management:**
*Whenever we use Client-Side State Management, the state related information will directly get stored on the client-side. 
*That specific information will travel back and communicate with every request generated by the user 
    then afterwards provides responses after server-side communication.

Client-Side State Management techniques are,
a.View State
b.Hidden field
c.Cookies
d.Control State
e.Query Strings

| ***\*view state\****                                         | ***\*hidden field\****                                       | ***\*cookies\****                                            |

| l the user wants to maintain or store their data temporarily after a post-back<br /> It is page-level State Management <br />Used for holding data temporarily<br />l Can store any type of data<br />l Property dependent | l A hidden field is used for storing small amounts of data on the client side.<br />l It is invisible in the browser. | l A set of Cookies is a small text file that is stored in the user's hard drive using the client's browser.<br />l two types 1.Persistent Cookie  2.non-Persistent Cookie <br />l Store information temporarily<br />l It's just a simple small sized text file<br />l Can be changed depending on requirements<br />l User Preferred<br />l Requires only a few bytes or KBs of space for creating cookies**l** |

 

| ***\*control state\****                                      | ***\*query string\****                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| l Control state is based on the custom control option<br />l Can't be modified<br />l Accessed directly or disabled | l These in a general case are used for holding some value from a different page and move these values to the different page.<br />l The information stored in it can be easily navigated to one page to another or to the same page as well. |

**2.Server-Side State Management**

- Server-Side State Management is different from Client-Side State Management but the operations and working is somewhat the same in functionality.

* In Server-Side State Management all the information is stored in the user memory. 
*Due to this functionality there is more secure domains at the server side in comparison to Client-Side State Management.

Server-Side State Management techniques
--Session State
--Application State

| ***\*session state\****                                      | ***\*application state\****                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.l you can use the session object to store the value which is accessible throughout the application in single browser<br /> 2.he Session cannot be accessible outside of the browser where it has been created.<br /> 3. Every browser creates own session.<br />4. If you leave the application or your session is going to time out then you will not access the session data.<br />5. the session data lost after specific time period. | 1.It is a global storage to store the value which will be accessible to all the pages. l It also store the data into key/value pair.l<br /> 2.The information stored into application state is accessible to all the page.l application state data is not permanent. l <br />3.If you restart or shutdown your application then application state will lost. |
